# Team Roster Generator

This application is for build a Node.js command line that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person - roster. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, the app also include codes for TDD to ensure that all unit tests pass.

## Description

The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
